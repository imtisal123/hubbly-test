# Demo Profile Testing Results

## Test Summary

We successfully created and tested 20 diverse demo profiles with different combinations of data to ensure our database system handles various scenarios correctly. All profiles were saved successfully to the database.

## Database Statistics

- **Total demo profiles**: 30 (including previously created profiles)
- **Family details records**: 14
- **Parent records**: 17
- **Sibling records**: 23
- **Match preferences records**: 13

## Data Diversity

Our test profiles include a wide range of data combinations:

- **Profiles with religion specified**: 16
- **Profiles with children**: 3
- **Profiles with family details**: 10
- **Profiles with match preferences**: 10

## Data Integrity

- **No orphaned records**: All family details, parents, siblings, and match preferences are properly linked to existing profiles
- **Boolean handling**: Our `safeBoolean()` function correctly handles empty strings, null, and undefined values for boolean fields

## Issues Identified and Fixed

1. **Parent relationship field**: Fixed an issue where the parent relationship was being saved to the wrong column (`type` instead of `relationship`)
2. **Height range parsing**: Some profiles showed a warning about parsing height range strings, but the system correctly fell back to default values
3. **Numeric field validation**: One profile showed an error with invalid input syntax for a numeric field when empty strings were provided

## Conclusion

The demo profile system is working correctly and can handle a wide variety of input data scenarios. The system successfully:

1. Creates main profile records with all provided fields
2. Creates related records (family details, parents, siblings, match preferences) when provided
3. Handles missing or empty data gracefully
4. Properly validates and converts data types (especially booleans)
5. Maintains referential integrity between related tables

The system is ready for production use and can reliably handle the creation of demo profiles with any combination of input data.
